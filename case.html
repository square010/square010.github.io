<ul><li><h3>Textile Industry </h3>The textile market includes yarns, fabrics, non-apparel, and apparel finished products.The value of each segment is for consumption , defined as domestic production plus imports minus exports , all valued at manufacturer prices. Fabrics cover woven,non-woven and knitted fabrics . <br>
	At current the Indian textile industry is pegged at US $55 billion , 64% of which services domestic demand . The textile industry accounts for 14% if industrial production , which is 4% of GDP ; employs 35 million people and accounts for nearly 12% share of the country’s total exports basket. Industry is dominated by small , fragmented and non-integrated units with the exception of spinning sector , the spinning segments productions is dominated by large units and has been able to undergo significant modernization at a rapid rate .<br>
	India, like China, is a large, high-growth economy and an emerging market for international business. Adequate availability of  supply of textile material is one of the basic requirements for faster economic growth.There is a change in the consumer mindset that has led to a trend of increased consumption on personal care and lifestyle products as well as branded products. <br>

	After facing a sharp decline following the global downturn , the textile industry is on a recovery road now. Textile exports , which declined through most of the last fiscal year, have got some respite in the current year. Further the industry has been actively trying to diversify both , the direction as well as the basket of exports . Riding on the sops provided by the government under the Market Linked Focus Product Scheme the industry has been looking to export into new and relatively under tapped markets. A highly fragmented industry ,Technological obsolescence , rigid labour laws , intermediaries in supply chain and a wide supply and demand gap in training facilities remain largely unresolved. Also growing international competition and non availability of indigenous textile machinery are the main problems faced today by the Textile industry of India. </li>
	<li> Build a case for timely action on increasing domestic supply and growth of technical textile in India by commenting on the likely changes to be introduced in technology or policies </li>
<li>Discuss the role of increase in exports in the advancement of textile sector in India .  </li>
<li>Recommend a road map for 2030 for India to be more advanced in textile industry and come out as one of an important on in technical textiles.  </li>
<li>Discuss the recommendations from various government and ministerial committees towards this goal.</li>
<li>International best practices on advancement of textile industry: Discuss two countries of relevance and their approach – specific points only.</li>
<li>Discuss the extant textile industry policy framework. Recommend on whether India needs a new policy design for the sector. </li>
